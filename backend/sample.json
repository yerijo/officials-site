                                "Named “Best Governor in the Nation” in 2020, Governor Greg Abbott is building upon his record as a strong conservative leader who fights to preserve Texas values and ensure the Lone Star State remains the best place to live, work, and raise a family.\\n\\nGovernor Abbott’s vision for an even stronger Texas of tomorrow is focused on creating more jobs and economic opportunity, educating the leaders of the next generation, protecting individual liberties, restoring parental rights in education, and securing the southern border in the face of federal inaction.\\n\\n \\n\\nBuilding the Texas of Tomorrow\\nSince brave pioneers first settled the untamed Wild West, Texas has offered the freedom and opportunities that can be found nowhere else. Each year Governor Abbott has been in office, Texas has been the number one state for business in America. As home to more Fortune 500 headquarters than any other state, the more than $2 trillion Texas economy is the 9th largest in the world. And as the number one state for tech exports, “Made in Texas” has never been a bigger brand.",

                                "Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the first of four children of Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden and Joseph Robinette Biden, Sr. In 1953, the Biden family moved to Claymont, Delaware. President Biden graduated from the University of Delaware and Syracuse Law School and served on the New Castle County Council. \\n\\nJOE BIDEN’S FAMILY \\nAt age 29, President Biden became one of the youngest people ever elected to the United States Senate. Just weeks after his Senate election, tragedy struck the Biden family when his wife Neilia and daughter Naomi were killed, and sons Hunter and Beau were critically injured, in an auto accident.\\n\\nBiden was sworn into the U.S. Senate at his sons’ hospital bedsides and began commuting from Wilmington to Washington every day, first by car, and then by train, in order to be with his family. He would continue to do so throughout his time in the Senate. \\n\\nBiden married Jill Jacobs in 1977, and in 1980, their family was complete with the birth of Ashley Blazer Biden. A lifelong educator, Jill earned her doctorate in education and returned to teaching as an English professor at a community college in Virginia.\\n\\nBeau Biden, Attorney General of Delaware and Joe Biden’s eldest son, passed away in 2015 after battling brain cancer with the same integrity, courage, and strength he demonstrated every day of his life. Beau’s fight with cancer inspires the mission of President Biden’s life — ending cancer as we know it.\\n\\nA LEADER IN THE SENATE\\nAs a Senator from Delaware for 36 years, President Biden established himself as a leader in facing some of our nation’s most important domestic and international challenges. As Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee for 16 years, Biden is widely recognized for his work writing and spearheading the Violence Against Women Act  — the landmark legislation that strengthens penalties for violence against women, creates unprecedented resources for survivors of assault, and changes the national dialogue on domestic and sexual assault.\\n\\nAs Chairman or Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years, Biden played a pivotal role in shaping U.S. foreign policy. He was at the forefront of issues and legislation related to terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, post-Cold War Europe, the Middle East, Southwest Asia, and ending apartheid.\\n\\n“America is an idea. An idea that is stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It gives hope to the most desperate people on earth, it guarantees that everyone is treated with dignity and gives hate no safe harbor. It instills in every person in this country the belief that no matter where you start in life, there’s nothing you can’t achieve if you work at it. That’s what we believe.”\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, APRIL 25, 2019\\nTHE 47TH VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES \\nAs Vice President, Biden continued his leadership on important issues facing the nation and represented our country abroad. Vice President Biden convened sessions of the President’s Cabinet, led interagency efforts, and worked with Congress in his fight to raise the living standards of middle-class Americans, reduce gun violence, address violence against women, and end cancer as we know it.\\n\\nBiden helped President Obama pass and then oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act — the biggest economic recovery plan in the history of the nation and our biggest and strongest commitment to clean energy. The President’s plan prevented another Great Depression, created and saved millions of jobs, and led to 75 uninterrupted months of job growth by the end of the administration. And Biden did it all with less than 1% in waste, abuse, or fraud — the most efficient government program in our country’s history.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Vice President Biden also secured the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 20 million by the time they left office and banned insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions.\\n\\nHe served as the point person for U.S. diplomacy throughout the Western Hemisphere, strengthened relationships with our allies both in Europe and the Asia-Pacific, and led the effort to bring 150,000 troops home from Iraq.\\n\\nIn a ceremony at the White House, President Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction — the nation’s highest civilian honor.\\n\\nA NEW CHAPTER\\nAfter leaving the White House, the Bidens continued their efforts to expand opportunity for every American with the creation of the Biden Foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative, the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, and the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.\\n\\nOn April 25, 2019, Biden announced his candidacy for President of the United States. Biden’s candidacy was built from the beginning around 3 pillars: the battle for the soul of our nation, the need to rebuild our middle class — the backbone of our country, and a call for unity, to act as One America. It was a message that would only gain more resonance in 2020 as we confront a pandemic, an economic crisis, urgent calls for racial justice, and the existential threat of climate change.",

                                "Antony J. Blinken is the 71st U.S. Secretary of State.\\n\\nHe was nominated by President Biden on November 23, 2020; confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 26, 2021; and sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris the following day.\\n\\nOver three decades and three presidential administrations, Mr. Blinken has helped shape U.S. foreign policy to ensure it protects U.S. interests and delivers results for the American people. He served as deputy secretary of state for President Barack Obama from 2015 to 2017, and before that, as President Obama’s principal deputy national security advisor. In that role, Mr. Blinken chaired the interagency deputies committee, the main forum for hammering out the administration’s foreign policy.\\n\\nDuring the first term of the Obama Administration, Mr. Blinken was national security advisor to then-Vice President Joe Biden. This was the continuation of a long professional relationship that stretched back to 2002, when Mr. Blinken began his six-year stint as Democratic staff director for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Then-Senator Biden was the chair of that committee from 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.\\n\\nDuring the Clinton Administration, Mr. Blinken served as a member of the National Security Council staff, including two years as the senior director for European affairs, the president’s principal advisor on the countries of Europe, the European Union, and NATO. He also spent four years as President Clinton’s chief foreign policy speechwriter, and he led the NSC’s strategic planning team.\\n\\nMr. Blinken’s public service began at the State Department. From 1993 to 1994, he was a special assistant in what was then called the Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs. Now he is proud to lead the department where he got his start in government nearly 30 years ago.\\n\\nOutside of government, Mr. Blinken has worked in the private sector, civil society, and journalism. He was a founder of WestExec Advisors, an international strategic consulting firm focused on geopolitics and national security. He was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 2001 and 2002. Before joining government, Mr. Blinken practiced law in New York and Paris. He was also a reporter for The New Republic magazine and is the author of Ally Versus Ally: America, Europe and the Siberian Pipeline Crisis (Praeger, 1987).\\n\\nMr. Blinken attended grade school and high school in Paris, where he received a French Baccalaureat degree with high honors. He is a graduate of Harvard College\u202fand Columbia Law School. He and his wife Evan Ryan have two children.",

                                "Commissioner Buckingham’s family were among the first settlers to Texas seven generations ago, and that tough, independent, pioneer spirit is deeply rooted in her personality. True to her Texas roots, her commitment to service began early, serving as a volunteer firefighter, and attending the Texas A&M Fire School. She is also an avid hunter, outdoorswoman, and steward of the land. She made history in 2016 as the first woman elected to the Texas State Senate from Travis County. Without slowing down, she made history again in 2022 when elected as the 29th, and state’s first female Commissioner of the General Land Office, Texas’ oldest state agency. .\\n\\nDawn came from humble roots—growing up on a ranch near the Texas coast and then moved to Central Texas. She has never settled for less than her dreams. Wanting to attend college, but without the money to do so, Dawn lived at home, working two jobs to pay her own way through college at the University of Texas at Austin. With endurance of spirit she graduated Magna Cum Laude and debt-free. It was during college that she met the love of her life and husband of 31 years, Ed Buckingham. Dawn and Ed both received their medical degrees from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and they have two children. Dawn then went on to become a successful Oculoplastic Surgeon. Her commitment to service and recognition for her work has allowed her to hold leadership positions in local, state, and national medical organizations.\\n\\nDawn embodies the American Dream. Through hard work, a “never-quit” attitude, and perseverance, she has risen above her circumstances. Becoming a self-made small business owner employing Texans, serving others in her profession and as an elected official, she has always given back to her community.\\n\\nAs your Land Commissioner, Dr. Dawn Buckingham brings a lifetime of experience to the office. She is committed to helping Texans after a disaster, supporting Texas energy, ensuring that every child in Texas receives a high-quality public education, serving Texas Veterans, and securing the border to keep our communities safe.",

He began his career as an elementary teacher. He then served as a school principal in Meriden in 2003 where he led a school with outstanding programming for three to five-year-olds, students that were bilingual, and students with sensory exceptionalities. He proudly served in this role for ten years. In 2012, Miguel won the 2012 National Distinguished Principal Award for the State of CT and the Outstanding Administrator Award from UCONN's NEAG School of Education. Secretary Cardona then transitioned to lead the work of Performance and Evaluation in the district. He then assumed the role of Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning, overseeing teaching, learning, and leadership alignment.\\n\\nA lifelong Meriden resident, Dr. Cardona attended Meriden Connecticut Public Schools and graduated from Wilcox Technical High School.

                                "Sarah Eckhardt is honored to have been elected the Senator for Bastrop and Travis Counties in July of 2020.\\n\\nSenator Eckhardt has deep roots in Central Texas and deep commitment to improving opportunity for all Texans. After receiving an LBJ School Master of Public Affairs and law degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 1998, Eckhardt worked for eight years as an Assistant Travis County Attorney. From 2006-2013 she served as Travis County Commissioner representing 300,000 people. From 2015-2020 she served as the Travis County Judge presiding over the Commissioners Court and representing 1.3 million people.\\n\\nSenator Eckhardt believes that elective office is a temporary trust bestowed by the people who elect her. She values policy above politics. And she believes that government exists to assure that opportunity is within reach of every Texan.\\n\\nEckhardt's public service experience includes emergency response, health care, workforce and economic development, criminal justice, water policy, budget and finance. Some of her previous accomplishments include curtailing the spread of COVID-19 in Central Texas through early and decisive region-wide orders, preserving more than 30,000 acres of green space, building a multi-county collaboration for the preservation of groundwater, maintaining a vibrant construction economy while raising safety standards for workers, establishing a Travis County Public Defender's Office, and instituting jail and arrest diversion programs that support justice and public safety.\\n\\nSenator Eckhardt learned public service from her mother and father and is inspired to continue serving by her son and daughter. Her mother Nadine Eckhardt and her father Congressman Bob Eckhardt served Texas and especially the most vulnerable Texans in the halls of the State Capitol and the US Capitol. Her children Nadine (high school senior) and Hank (college sophomore) inspire her daily to make Texas a better place for generations to come.",

The Sunset Act puts an expiration date on certain agencies and only allows for its continued existence if state lawmakers pass a bill re-authorizing it. \\n\\nIn 2019, Texas re-authorized the PUC via the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), which stated the act would be effective for six years, until 2025-09-01. It says there should be 3 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. \\n\\nIn 2021, all PUC commissioners resigned following the power grid disaster and a new PURA was passed, which stated the act would be effective for two years, until 2023-09-01. It says there should be 5 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. It took effect on 2021-06-27.\\n\\nIn 2023, verify that a new PURA is passed and check for changes in statute. Either check statute, or may be posted on Texas PUC website: https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/statutes/statutes.aspx.\\n\\nAlso note that because of all this flux, current commissioners may not reflect 6-year terms.

                                "Secretary Deb Haaland made history when she became the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary. She is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna and a 35th generation New Mexican. \\n\\nSecretary Haaland grew up in a military family; her father was a 30-year combat Marine who was awarded the Silver Star Medal for saving six lives in Vietnam, and her mother is a Navy veteran who served as a federal employee for 25 years at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As a military child, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from Highland High School in Albuquerque.  \\n\\nAs a single mother, Secretary Haaland volunteered at her child's pre-school to afford early childhood education. Like many parents, she had to rely on food stamps at times as a single parent, lived paycheck-to-paycheck, and struggled to put herself through college. At the age of 28, Haaland enrolled at the University of New Mexico (UNM) where she earned a Bachelor’s degree in English and later earned her J.D. from UNM Law School. Secretary Haaland and her child, who also graduated from the University of New Mexico, are still paying off student loans. \\n\\nSecretary Haaland ran her own small business producing and canning Pueblo Salsa, served as a tribal administrator at San Felipe Pueblo, and became the first woman elected to the Laguna Development Corporation Board of Directors, overseeing business operations of the second largest tribal gaming enterprise in New Mexico. She successfully advocated for the Laguna Development Corporation to create policies and commitments to environmentally friendly business practices. \\n\\nThroughout her career in public service, Secretary Haaland has broken barriers and opened the doors of opportunity for future generations.  \\n\\nAfter running for New Mexico Lieutenant Governor in 2014, Secretary Haaland became the first Native American woman to be elected to lead a State Party. She is one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. In Congress, she focused on environmental justice, climate change, missing and murdered indigenous women, and family-friendly policies.",

                                "Kamala D. Harris is the Vice President of the United States of America. She was elected Vice President after a lifetime of public service, having been elected District Attorney of San Francisco, California Attorney General, and United States Senator.\\n\\nVice President Harris was born in Oakland, California to parents who emigrated from India and Jamaica. She graduated from Howard University and the University of California, Hastings College of Law.\\n\\nVice President Harris with her mother, Shyamala\\n“My mother would look at me and she’d say, ‘Kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you are not the last.’”\\n\\nVice President Harris and her sister, Maya Harris, were primarily raised and inspired by their mother, Shyamala Gopalan. Gopalan, a breast cancer scientist and pioneer in her own right, received her doctorate the same year Vice President Harris was born. \\n\\nHer parents were activists, instilling Vice President Harris with a strong sense of justice. They brought her to civil rights demonstrations and introduced role models—ranging from Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall to civil rights leader Constance Baker Motley—whose work motivated her to become a prosecutor. \\n\\nGrowing up, Vice President Harris was surrounded by a diverse community and extended family. In 2014, she married Douglas Emhoff. They have a large blended family that includes their children, Ella and Cole.\\n\\nVice President Harris smiles at a crowd at the Pride Parade in San Francisco, CA, accompanied with her husband, Doug, and her niece, Meena\\nVice President Harris at the Pride Parade in San Francisco, California\\nThroughout her career, the Vice President has been guided by the words she spoke the first time she stood up in court: Kamala Harris, for the people.\\n\\nIn 1990, Vice President Harris joined the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office where she specialized in prosecuting child sexual assault cases. She then served as a managing attorney in the San Francisco District Attorney’s Office and later was chief of the Division on Children and Families for the San Francisco City Attorney’s Office. \\n\\nShe was elected District Attorney of San Francisco in 2003. In that role, Vice President Harris created a ground-breaking program to provide first-time drug offenders with the opportunity to earn a high school degree and find employment. The program was designated as a national model of innovation for law enforcement by the United States Department of Justice. \\n\\nIn 2010, Vice President Harris was elected California’s Attorney General and oversaw the largest state justice department in the United States. She established the state’s first Bureau of Children’s Justice and instituted several first-of-their-kind reforms that ensured greater transparency and accountability in the criminal justice system. \\n\\nAs Attorney General, Vice President Harris won a $20 billion settlement for Californians whose homes had been foreclosed on, as well as a $1.1 billion settlement for students and veterans who were taken advantage of by a for-profit education company. She defended the Affordable Care Act in court, enforced environmental law, and was a national leader in the movement for marriage equality.\\n\\nIn 2017, Vice President Harris was sworn into the United States Senate. In her first speech, she spoke out on behalf of immigrants and refugees who were then under attack. As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, she fought for better protections for DREAMers and called for better oversight of substandard conditions at immigrant detention facilities.\\n\\nOn the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, she worked with members of both parties to keep the American people safe from foreign threats and crafted bipartisan legislation to assist in securing American elections. She visited Iraq, Jordan, and Afghanistan to meet with servicemembers and assess the situation on the ground. She also served on the Senate Judiciary Committee. During her tenure on the committee, she participated in hearings for two Supreme Court nominees. \\n\\nAs Senator, Vice President Harris championed legislation to reform cash bail, combat hunger, provide rent relief, improve maternal health care, and address the climate crisis as a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Her bipartisan anti-lynching bill passed the Senate in 2018. Her legislation to preserve Historically Black Colleges and Universities was signed into law, as was her effort to infuse much-needed capital into low-income communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nOn August 11, 2020, Vice President Harris accepted President Joe Biden’s invitation to become his running mate and help unite the nation. She is the first woman, the first Black American, and the first South Asian American to be elected Vice President, as was the case with other offices she has held. She is, however, determined not to be the last.",

He’s a 1993 graduate of Texas A&M University and earned his law degree at St. Mary’s University. Glenn has served in the Texas Legislature, where he worked on issues including public education, transportation, tax reform, government transparency, Second Amendment rights, water issues and tort reform.\\n\\nAs comptroller, Glenn is chief finance officer for the world’s ninth-largest economy. He has emerged as a passionate advocate for conservative financial management and government transparency who has focused on creating a more efficient and customer oriented agency.  He founded the state’s Transparency Stars program, pushed for smarter ways of investing our rainy day fund to protect it for future generations, and guided the formation of the nation’s first ever state-administered precious metals depository.\\n\\nHis upbringing taught him the core values of hard work, honesty and integrity — the same values he and his wife Dara work to instill in their three young children, Claire, Julia and Jonah. Hegar’s most important title throughout his years of service is the one closest to home: Dad!",

                                "First elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2016, Gina Hinojosa proudly serves the constituents of District 49 in the heart of Austin and the Central corridor of the Texas capital city.\\n\\nDuring the 85th Legislative Session, her first session in the House, Rep. Hinojosa passed a sweeping, corporate reform bill that created a new type of corporation in the state of Texas, a\"public benefit corporation.\" This law now allows corporations to prioritize a public good while maximizing profits. Since then, hundreds of new Texas businesses have been created that spur economic development AND contribute to quality of life.\\n\\nHer first policy love being \"public education,\" Rep. Hinojosa led the House Democrats’ successful effort to divert more taxpayer money from state coffers into our public schools through House Bill 3 during the 86th Legislative Session. She also spearheaded legislative oversight of the Texas Education Agency's treatment of students receiving special education. And Rep. Hinojosa amended the public school accountability system to give high schools, students, and districts credit for college courses called \"Onramps.\"\\n\\nDuring the 86th Legislative Session, Rep. Hinojosa also was the House sponsor of then senator, Kirk Watson's SB 1350, a law that has now pulled down almost a billion dollars in federal funds to pay for indigent health care in Travis County.\\n\\nShe has been a leader on environmental policy, spearheading the creation of the Texas Climate Plan, and the Texas Youth Climate Corp. During the 87th Legislative Session, she passed legislation to identify employment opportunities for Texans in the transition to clean energy.\\n\\nRep. Hinojosa is a fierce defender of Austin's local control, having used procedural points of order during the 87th Legislative Session to kill both a bill to strip Austin of its noise ordinance authority and a bill that would have removed Austin's right of independence to purchase affordable housing.\\n\\nLast session, Rep. Hinojosa also preserved prevailing wage requirements on public building projects by \"filibustering\" a bill to dismantle them.\\n\\nShe capped off the 87th Legislative Session by organizing the first House Democratic Caucus Quorum Break in response to the anti-voter bill, SB 7. The Quorum Break resulted in the preservation of the will of Texas voters by killing a provision that would have allowed partisan judges to overturn election results without first finding that fraud had determined the outcome. The Quorum Break also preserved the freedom of Sunday morning voting, which is a longstanding practice of African American faith communities.\\n\\nPrior to becoming a Texas House member, Rep. Hinojosa was elected to an at-large position on the Austin ISD School Board in November 2012. Thereafter, she was elected Board President by her fellow trustees in January 2015. In the time that Gina served on the School Board, she led successful efforts on workers’ rights and partnered with the City of Austin to secure millions in additional funding for students. Under her leadership, every AISD high school met state accountability standards for the first time, a major step forward in improving academic performance for all students.\\n\\nBorn and raised in the Rio Grande Valley, Gina is a native Texan and a proud product of public schools. She came to Austin to attend The University of Texas and graduated with Honors with a Plan II Government Bachelor of Arts degree. She received her law degree from George Washington Law School in 1999 and was licensed that same year. She has called Austin home ever since.",

The Sunset Act puts an expiration date on certain agencies and only allows for its continued existence if state lawmakers pass a bill re-authorizing it. \\n\\nIn 2019, Texas re-authorized the PUC via the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), which stated the act would be effective for six years, until 2025-09-01. It says there should be 3 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. \\n\\nIn 2021, all PUC commissioners resigned following the power grid disaster and a new PURA was passed, which stated the act would be effective for two years, until 2023-09-01. It says there should be 5 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. It took effect on 2021-06-27.\\n\\nIn 2023, verify that a new PURA is passed and check for changes in statute. Either check statute, or may be posted on Texas PUC website: https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/statutes/statutes.aspx.\\n\\nAlso note that because of all this flux, current commissioners may not reflect 6-year terms. They may have been appointed to fill unexpired terms.",

                                "Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security by President Biden on February 2, 2021.  \\n\\nMayorkas is the first Latino and immigrant confirmed to serve as Secretary of Homeland Security. He has led a distinguished 30-year career as a law enforcement official and a nationally-recognized lawyer in the private sector. Mayorkas served as the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security from 2013 to 2016, and as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2009 to 2013. During his tenure at DHS, he led the development and implementation of DACA, negotiated cybersecurity and homeland security agreements with foreign governments, led the Department’s response to Ebola and Zika, helped build and administer the Blue Campaign to combat human trafficking, and developed an emergency relief program for orphaned youth following the tragic January 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Mayorkas also created the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate to better ensure the integrity of the legal immigration system.\\n\\nMayorkas began his government service in the Department of Justice, where he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California, specializing in the prosecution of white collar crime. After nearly nine years as a federal prosecutor, he became the youngest United States Attorney in the nation, overseeing prosecutions of national significance, including the investigation and prosecution of financial fraud, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, public corruption, violent crime, cybercrime, environmental crime, international money laundering, and securities fraud.\\n\\nMayorkas received his bachelor’s degree with distinction from the University of California at Berkeley and a law degree from Loyola Law School.",

The Sunset Act puts an expiration date on certain agencies and only allows for its continued existence if state lawmakers pass a bill re-authorizing it. \\n\\nIn 2019, Texas re-authorized the PUC via the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), which stated the act would be effective for six years, until 2025-09-01. It says there should be 3 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. \\n\\nIn 2021, all PUC commissioners resigned following the power grid disaster and a new PURA was passed, which stated the act would be effective for two years, until 2023-09-01. It says there should be 5 commissioners who serve staggered 6-year terms. It took effect on 2021-06-27.\\n\\nIn 2023, verify that a new PURA is passed and check for changes in statute. Either check statute, or may be posted on Texas PUC website: https://www.puc.texas.gov/agency/rulesnlaws/statutes/statutes.aspx.\\n\\nAlso note that because of all this flux, current commissioners may not reflect 6-year terms.

                                "An eighth-generation farmer and rancher, Sid Miller is the 12th Commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA). He has devoted his life to promoting Texas agriculture, rural communities and the great state of Texas.\\n\\nBorn in De Leon, in Comanche County, in September 1955, Sid Miller graduated with honors from Tarleton State University in Stephenville with a Bachelor of Science degree in Vocational Ag Education.\\n\\nA recognized community leader, Miller was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2000. He quickly earned a reputation as a staunch defender of Texas agriculture, constitutional freedoms and individual liberties for all Texans.\\n\\nHe was elected statewide as the 12th Texas Agriculture Commissioner in 2014, and re-elected to his second term in office in 2018.\\n\\nSince taking office as Agriculture Commissioner, Commissioner Miller has brought real, common sense reform to TDA. Within six months in office, he eliminated a two-and-a-half-year backlog in organic certifications. He reshaped field operations to maximize efficiency for Texas taxpayers. This included increasing the number of consumer protection inspections by as much as 183 percent while slashing the miles traveled by TDA inspectors by more than half a million miles a year.\\n\\nCommissioner Miller also launched Operation Maverick, a consumer protection initiative to round up businesses which failed to register their commercial scales with TDA. Registrations have increased 35 percent, and more than 2,000 previously unregistered businesses are now monitored by TDA to ensure consumers are protected.\\n\\nA former ag teacher and school board member, Commissioner Miller is committed to fighting childhood obesity and promoting healthy lifestyles for Texas schoolchildren. His creation of Farm Fresh Fridays and other farm-to-school initiatives resulted in a $14 million increase in the amount of Texas products purchased by schools. Commissioner Miller is also passionate about ensuring rural communities have the water and infrastructure they need to thrive. To that end, he created TDA’s Office of Water to ensure all Texans have access to clean water for today and future generations. Additionally, under his guidance, TDA has directed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding through the Texas Community Development Block Grant program to local communities for infrastructure improvements and repairs.\\n\\nCommissioner Miller is the state’s leading advocate around the world for Texas agriculture, Texas-grown products and Texas-owned businesses. He oversees TDA’s world-renowned GO TEXAN program — a marketing effort to showcase the best products, companies and communities that call the Lone Star State home. Since taking office, Commissioner Miller’s passion to increase market exposure for Texas agriculture has led him and his staff to mount trade missions to Cuba, Ecuador, Argentina, Israel, China and every continent on the globe, except Antarctica.\\n\\nCommissioner Miller is a businessman who breeds and trains American Quarter Horses. In his spare time, he is a recognized rodeo cowboy who holds 12 world championship titles.\\n\\nHe and his wife, Debra, have been married for going on 40 years. They have two sons, two daughters-in-law and five grandchildren. They are active members of the Cowboy Church of Erath County, where Commissioner Miller also serves as an elder.\\n",

                                "Appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, Mike Morath took office as Commissioner of Education in January 2016 and was unanimously confirmed by the Texas Senate (85th Legislature) in March 2017.\\n\\nAs Commissioner, he heads the Texas Education Agency, which oversees pre-kindergarten through high school education for more than 5.5 million students enrolled in both traditional independent school districts and public charter schools.\\n\\nPrior to becoming the state’s Education Commissioner, Morath served on the Dallas Independent School District board of trustees for more than four years. During that time, he focused on academic improvements. And by his final year on the board, DISD had seen improvement in various areas including rise in kindergarten readiness, math proficiency and graduation rates.\\n\\nA strong advocate of public education, Commissioner Morath graduated from Garland High School in the Garland Independent School District. And thanks to the great public school education he received in Texas, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Business Administration degree, summa cum laude, from George Washington University in two-and-a-half years.\\n\\nWhile starting his first company, Commissioner Morath was asked to teach an advanced computer science class at his high school alma mater after the previous teacher resigned suddenly. He taught through the school year until a permanent teacher was hired and remains amazed at how difficult it is to teach.\\n\\nWith a belief system that continually calls him to serve others, Commissioner Morath has participated in numerous volunteer activities, including church Missions Team, schools and juvenile justice facilities and serving as a mentor Big Brother. While in Dallas, he helped organize a trip to orphanages in southern India to set up clean running water systems, and volunteered at an eye clinic in rural Mexico, where he met another volunteer, Dr. Laura Vondra, who is now his wife. They are the proud parents of two daughters and two sons.",

                                "Dan Patrick was first elected Lt. Governor of Texas in 2014 and re-elected in 2018. A preeminent voice for principled conservative policies both in Texas and across the nation, Lt. Gov. Patrick is leading the fight for life and liberty in Texas including securing the border, reducing property and business taxes, standing up for the Second Amendment and addressing Texas’ infrastructure challenges to assure that our state continues to flourish economically.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick presided over what have been called the most conservative and productive sessions of the State Senate in Texas history. Focusing on strategies to keep Texas families and communities safe and the state economy strong, under his leadership, the Senate passed legislation to dramatically increase support for border security and reduced the franchise tax by 25% on a pathway to eliminating it all together.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick has championed property tax relief over several legislative sessions and continued the education reforms he began as Chair of the Senate Education Committee, tackling the problems of failing schools and giving parents more choices for their children.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick is an outspoken supporter of law enforcement and, among other things, initiated a program that ensures that every police officer on patrol in Texas has a bullet proof vest that is capable of withstanding a high caliber rifle shot.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick passed the sonogram bill and has championed numerous other measures to support and protect every life in Texas.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick is a member of the Board of the Republican Lt. Governor’s Association. Before he was elected Lt. Governor, he was twice elected to the Texas Senate representing part of Houston and Northwest Harris County. He is a successful small-business man and radio host, a former television anchor, sportscaster, musician, Christian author and movie producer.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick is also involved in his community. He has raised over $16 million for children with disabilities through his radio show and started the first seminary in a Texas prison to train long-serving inmates for the ministry.\\n\\nLt. Governor Patrick has been married to his wife Jan, a former schoolteacher, for 43 years. They are the proud parents of son Ryan and daughter Shane, and the grandparents to five grandchildren.",

                                "Zohaib “Zo” Qadri was elected to represent District 9 in 2022. He proudly represents the neighborhoods of Downtown, Rainey St., Old West Austin, West Campus, Hyde Park, Travis Heights, Bouldin Creek, Mueller, Cherrywood, and more. Zo is eager to tackle Austin’s housing crisis, to fight for an expanded and equitable transit system, and to protect and uplift our most vulnerable citizens. Zo firmly believes that everyone deserves a voice and access to the abundance of opportunities in our beautiful city. \\n\\nThe first-born child of immigrants, Zo moved to Texas at the age of 12 with his parents and two younger sisters. His younger brother was born 5 years later. Initially hoping to follow in the footsteps of his parents, Zo moved to Austin to pursue a career in medicine by starting a degree in biology at the University of Texas. After witnessing first-hand how the local cost of living crisis is inflicting on Austin’s most vulnerable residents, Zo was inspired to improve his adopted community and decided to switch paths by studying the humanities. Zo later received a Masters of Public Administration from Texas State University and a second graduate degree from Rice University in Global Affairs.\\n\\nAfter finishing his graduate studies, Zo plunged head-first into community advocacy and political campaigns. In 2018, he helped direct political outreach to AAPI voters during Beto O’Rourke’s 2018 U.S. Senate run. Zo later merged his academic knowledge with real world experience in the legislative process during his time as a legislative assistant in the Texas House of Representatives. Zo’s leadership skills and love of coaching others to reach diverse voters led him to South Carolina during the 2020 Democratic Primary, where he helped lead Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign as a Regional Organizing Director.",

                                "Gina M. Raimondo serves as the 40th U.S. Secretary of Commerce and was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on March 3, 2021. As Secretary of Commerce, she is focused on a simple but vital mission — to spur good-paying jobs, empower entrepreneurs to innovate and grow, and help American workers and businesses compete.\\n\\nSecretary Raimondo was formerly the 75th Governor of Rhode Island and its first woman governor. She grew up in Smithfield in a tight-knit Italian-American family, the youngest of Joseph and Josephine Raimondo's three children. Her family history and her childhood experiences shaped her core beliefs in hard work, opportunity for all, and the importance of financial security.\\n\\nAfter arriving from Italy at age 14, Secretary Raimondo’s grandfather learned English studying in the Providence Public Library and later lived with her family. Her mother was a homemaker, who dedicated her life to teaching her children about the importance of hard work and determination. Her father was a World War II Navy veteran from a family of butchers and became the first in his family to attend college thanks to the GI Bill. After working for 26 years in manufacturing, Joseph lost his job along with hundreds of others when the factory moved overseas, and the Raimondo family lost their sense of financial security.\\n\\nAs a teenager, Secretary Raimondo rode a public bus to LaSalle Academy in Providence, where she was valedictorian of her graduating class. She went on to graduate with honors from Harvard, where she was recognized as the top economics student in her class. She won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University where she earned a doctorate and met her future husband Andy Moffit. She later graduated from Yale Law School. Secretary Raimondo clerked for US District Judge Kimba Wood and served as founding employee and senior vice president at Village Ventures.\\n\\nWanting to start her own business and be close to family, she returned home to Rhode Island and founded Point Judith Capital, a venture capital firm. In November 2010, Secretary Raimondo was elected to serve as General Treasurer of Rhode Island, receiving the largest number of votes of any statewide candidate. When she took office as General Treasurer, she tackled the state's $7 billion unfunded pension liability. Secretary Raimondo was sworn into office as Governor in January 2015 and won a second term in 2018. She also served as chair of the Democratic Governors’ Association in 2019.\\n\\nSecretary Raimondo is married to Andy Moffit and they have two children, Ceci and Tommy, and a rescue dog, Sparky.",
